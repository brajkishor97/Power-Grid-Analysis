# Power-Grid-Analysis

* This project aims to do a steady state power grid analysis by Random Walk method.
* ibm2 is the spice netlist of a power grid of an IBM chip. 
* The output of the program is the node voltages of all the node of the power grid of ibm2. 
* This project was done as a part of my internship at IIT Guwahati during summer 2018.

To run, execute:

1. `g++ randomWalkSerial.cpp -o randomWalkSerial`

2. `./randomWalkSerial ibm2`
